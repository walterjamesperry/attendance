This is the App for the Austin Coding Academy Chapter two assignment.
This app was a good challenge for me. Mainly because I have not coded in javascript in a while. But after I finished chap3 and 4 the JavaScript concepts all came back to me.

But anyways I liked this assignment because although we had all the knowledge to complete this assignment it required me to quickly learn if I had an efficent understanding of the node/express web project workflow and it also required us to use and test  our pevious developer knowledge to see if we could adapt our own knowledge and use it with the new tools and node/express concepts. 

Ultimately I learned to watch for grammer and syntax mistakes. and to always know what indo is being passed in the variables.
